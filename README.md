In the first one of the output, the name were different so it be "false", the Object are different as well be cause the parameter that it get are not equal "Cat" and "Mouse".

The second one, the name were the same so it be "true". Before I fix it, the Object be "false" because it were in the different memory, but in fact it need to be "true" because the name were the same so it comes in the same class.

The last one, the name were the same but a is a Person but c is a Student, so it have the id. Before I fixed it, it be "true" because it check only the name, but in fact it goes to the different class. For the Object, it was in the different Object as the name were differet.
